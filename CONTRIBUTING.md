Thanks for your interest in contributing!

## How to contribute
1. Open an issue first to discuss a change (bug or feature).
2. Fork the repo and create a branch: `git checkout -b feat/my-change`.
3. Commit with clear messages and reference the issue.
4. Open a Pull Request (PR).

## Code style
- Keep examples minimal and well-commented.
- Prefer PDO ODBC over legacy `odbc_*` functions in examples.
- Do not commit IBM packages or license-protected files.

## Documentation
- Update README.md when steps or versions change.
- Add to the Troubleshooting section if you hit a new gotcha.

PRs welcome! :)
